Fibonacci coding:
================
1) Positive Integers to binary code words.
2) Self-synchronizing as every code word ends with 11 and you don't see that sequence anywhere else.
3) Zeckendorfâ€™s Theorem: Every positive integer can be written uniquely as a sum of distinct non-neighbouring Fibonacci numbers.
